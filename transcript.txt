| General Memo to Faculty:
|
| As you may have heard, there was a minor accident last week in lab A431. We
| have determined that the incident was the result of failure to observe
| standard safety practices, which are mandatory for all faculty. Failure to
| observe standard safety practices will result in disciplinary action.
|
| We encourage all faculty to take a moment to review standard safety practices
| for their lab. If you do not have a copy of your lab's standard safety
| practices, you can request one from your lab supervisor.
|
| A safety crew will investigate lab A431 this week, but we do not believe the
| incident will impact any other labs. Please disregard rumors to the contrary.
|
| Richard Quest
| Facility Supervisor
